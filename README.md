# European banknotes classification using pre-trained Resnet18 and Densenet121

This repository contains an example use of pretrained networks available on PyTorch.

Following two pretrained models were compared for image classification task:

1. ResNet-18 model from [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf).
2. Densenet-121 model from [Densely Connected Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993).
